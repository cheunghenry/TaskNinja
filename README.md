## Description

This flutter application allows users to keep their lives organised by keeping track of different tasks that need to be completed. Users are able to create, edit, and delete events on the mobile app

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine.
3. Open the project in your IDE.
4. Run flutter “pub get” to download the necessary dependencies.
5. Run the app using your preferred method, such as running “flutter run” in the terminal.

## Usage

When opening the application, you will be prompted to login. Should you not have an existing account, simply click on the "Sign Up" button located below to create one. Upon successfully creating an account, you will be redirected to the login page where you can access the user-specific task menu - referred to as "shurikens". Under each shuriken, users can add tasks which can be expanded by clicking on the "Details" button. Additionally, users can easily edit tasks by pressing the same button. Once a user completes a task, they can simply go back and delete it.

If you ever need to return to the login/sign up page, simply click the arrow in the   top left side
